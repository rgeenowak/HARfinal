Codebook:
=========

The original HAR dataset was merged and cleaned in order to subset the average acceleration and velocity
for each physical activity across time. Each row includes an individual and one activity.


The dataset inludes the following variables:
=============================================

- Subject (n=30)
- Activity (n=6: walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, laying)
- Time and frequency measurements were collected.
- The following datapoints are an average of the mean and standard deviation per person and activity


Summary of individual measures:
===============================
- Average mean and standard deviation of triaxial acceleration (x,y,z axis) in standard gravity units 'g'.
- Average mean and standard deviation of euclidean magnitude and time derivatives.
- Average mean and standard deviation of body acceleration where substracted gravity from total acceleration
- Average mean and standard deviation of triaxial angular velocity (x,y,z axis) in radians/second


Individual measures (n=17 for 3 axes [x,y,z]), indicator of whether time and frequency collected, data variable names:
